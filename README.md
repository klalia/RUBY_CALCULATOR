# RUBY_CALCULATOR

This is a calculator done with ruby and can be used through git bash when in the ruby_calculator folder and by running ruby calc.rb. It has the basic options (+,-,*,/) as well as the option to square a number. The calculator is split into two with option 1 being basic and option 2 being advanced where you can use the square function.

It uses features such as $stdout.flush to get the output to appear straight away. There is also a gets.chomp feature that lets the user input a value and returns that value to the program, the .chomp at the end removes the line break (\n).
